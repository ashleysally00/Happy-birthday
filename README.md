## File Structure

```
birthday-card/
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ style.css
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sketch.js
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that structures the web page and includes necessary scripts.
- `style.css`: Contains the styles for centering the canvas and setting up the page layout.
- `sketch.js`: The p5.js script that creates the birthday card design.

## Customization

To customize the birthday card:

1. Modify the `sketch.js` file:
   - Change colors: Adjust the `background()` and `fill()` functions.
   - Modify text: Update the `text()` function calls.
   - Resize the canvas: Alter the values in `createCanvas()`.
   - Change the emoji: Replace the cupcake emoji in the `text()` function.

2. Adjust the styles in `style.css`:
   - Modify the centering or layout of the canvas.

3. Update the content in `index.html` if you need to add or remove elements.

## Code Breakdown

### sketch.js
```javascript
function setup() {
  var canvas = createCanvas(300, 400);
  canvas.parent("CanvasDiv");
}

function draw() {
  background(255, 99, 71);
  fill(255, 255, 255);
  stroke(19);
  textSize(40);
  text("happy", 70, 80);
  text("birthday", 100, 174);
  textSize(75);
  text("üßÅ", 103, 305);
  describe(
    "Happy birthday in white letters on tomato red background with a cupcake."
  );
}
```

This script creates a canvas, sets up the background color, and draws the "Happy Birthday" text and cupcake emoji. The `describe()` function provides an accessibility description for screen readers.

### style.css
```css
html, body {
  height: 100%;
}

body {
  margin: 0;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

These styles ensure that the canvas is centered both horizontally and vertically on the page.
